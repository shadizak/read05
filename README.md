# Welcome to Read 05 Task

## In this task was helpful so  I learned this concepts:

1. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." The "cascading" part means that when two styles conflict, the style that's lowest down in the document, which is where the newest content goes, is the one that gets applied.

2. CSS is written differently than HTML. You can see an example of a CSS code block below:
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
3. The selector, as shown in the above code block, specifies which element on your page you're modifying. Each property-value pair will be a style as you fill in the details. Inside the brackets, you add the styles you want to apply to that particular element.

4. Get comfortable using important tool to inspect and debug your websites Write and modify specific CSS selectors, attributes, and values to apply CSS styles (i.e., color and size)
